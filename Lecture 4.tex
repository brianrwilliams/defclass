\title{Lecture 4: More on dg Lie algebras}

\begin{document}

\section{Deformation from a dg Lie algebra}

\begin{prop}
There are natural isomorphisms
\[
T_{\MC_\fg} \cong Z^1(\fg)
\] 
and 
\[
T_{\Def_\fg} \cong H^1(\fg) .
\] 
\end{prop}

\subsection{}

Suppose we have a small exact sequence of Artinian algebras
\beqn\label{smallexact}
0 \to M \to B \xto{\sigma} A \to 0 .
\eeqn
We want to construct a map
\[
\theta_B : \MC_\fg(A) \to H^2(\fg) \tensor M .
\]
Given $x \in \MC_{\fg}(A) = \MC(\fg \tensor \fm_A)$, let $\Tilde{x} \in \MC_\fg(B) = \MC(\fg \tensor \fm_B)$ be a lift and consider the element 
\[
\theta'(x) = \d \Tilde{x} + \frac{1}{2}[\Tilde{x}, \Tilde{x}] \in \fg^2 \tensor \fm_B .
\] 
By assumption $\sigma(\theta'(x)) = 0$ and so $\theta'(x)$ determines an element $\theta(x) \in \fg^2 \tensor \fm_B$.
Moreover
\[
\d \theta(x) = [\d \Tilde{x}, \Tilde{x}] = [\theta(x), \Tilde{x}] - \frac{1}{2} [[\Tilde{x},\Tilde{x}],\Tilde{x}]  .
\]
The first term on the right-hand side is zero since $\fm_B \cdot M = 0$.
Moreover, the second term is zero by degree reasons. 
Thus, $\theta(x)$ is closed and determines an element $[\theta(x)] \in H^2(\fg) \tensor M$. 
It is an exercise to see that it does not depend on any choices. 

\begin{prop}
The assignment that sends any small exact sequence (\ref{smallexact}) to the map
\[
\theta_B : \MC_\fg(A) \to H^2(\fg) \tensor M
\]
defines a complete obstruction theory for $\MC_\fg$. 
\end{prop}

\section{Formal aspects of dg Lie algebras}

\def\oblv{{\rm oblv}}

It is a good time to remind ourselves of the formal situation that we are in. 
We have introduced the categories of dg commutative, dg associative, and dg Lie algebras.
All were obtained by putting some extra structure on a dg vector space (or cochain complex).
Thus, there are forgetful functors
\[
\oblv_{C}, \oblv_{A}, \oblv_L : \dgCAlg_k, \dgAss_k, \dgLie_k \to \dgVect_k .
\] 

\subsection{A slew of functors}

\subsubsection{The free algebras}

\subsubsection{The enveloping algebra}

\def\Tens{{\rm Tens}}

\begin{dfn}
The enveloping algebra functor is
\[
\begin{array}{cccc}
U : & \dgLie_k & \to & \dgAss_k \\
& \fg & \mapsto & \Tens(\fg) / \cJ
\end{array}
\]
where $\cJ$ is the dg ideal of $\Tens(\fg)$ generated by expressions of the form 
\[
x \tensor y - (-1)^{|x||y|} (y \tensor x) - [x,y].
\]
\end{dfn}

\begin{rmk}
Just like the tensor algebra, the enveloping algebra admits a natural increasing filtration
\[
F^{\leq k} U(\fg) = \left(\bigoplus_{0 \leq i \leq k} \fg^{\tensor i}\right) / \cJ .
\]
The associated graded ${\rm Gr} \; U(\fg)$ is naturally a dg algebra. 
In fact, it is a commutative dg algebra. 
By the Poincar\'{e}-Birkoff-Witt theorem, the natural linear map $\fg \to F^{\leq 1}U(\fg)$ induces an isomorphism of commutative dg algebras
\[
\Sym(\fg) = \bigoplus_{k \geq 0} \Sym^k(\fg) \xto{\cong} {\rm Gr} \; U(\fg) . 
\] 
\end{rmk}

\subsection{Quasi-isomorphisms}

A map of dg vector spaces (cochain complexes) $f : V \to W$ is a linear map of grading degree zero that commutes with the differentials. 
If $V = \{V^n\}_{n \in \ZZ}$, $W = \{W^n\}_{n \in \ZZ}$,
this is equivalent to the data of linear maps $f^n : V^n \to W^n$ for each $n$ such that $\d^n_W f^n = f^n \d^n_V$. 
Such a map induces a linear map in cohomology $H^*f : H^*(V) \to H^*(W)$. 

\begin{dfn}
A map of dg vector spaces $f : V \to W$ is a {\bf quasi-isomorphism} if $H^*(f) : H^*(V) \to H^*(W)$ is an isomorphism. 
In this case, we will write $f : V \xto{\simeq} W$. 
\end{dfn}

The definition for dg Lie algebras is similar. 
Note that a map of dg Lie algebra $f : \fg \to \fh$ is, in particular, compatible with the differentials on both sides. 
Thus, it induces a map in cohomology $H^*(f) : H^*(\fg) \to H^*(\fh)$.
This is a map of {\em graded} Lie algebras (dg Lie algebras with zero differential). 

\begin{dfn}
Let $f : \fg \to \fh$ be a map of dg Lie algebras. 
We say $f$ is a {\bf quasi-isomorphism} if the underlying map of dg vector spaces is a quasi-isomorphism.
\end{dfn}

This definition simply ports the notion of quasi-isomorphism of dg vector spaces to dg Lie algebras using the forgetful functor $\oblv_L : \dgLie_k \to \dgVect_k$. 
We can do the same trick for commutative and associative dg algebras.
Namely, a map of commutative/associative dg algebras is a quasi-isomorphism if and only if it is a quasi-isomorphism of underlying dg vector spaces. 

Given this, the following lemma is easy. 

\begin{lem}
A map of dg Lie algebras $f : \fg \to \fh$ is a quasi-isomorphism if and only if the induced map
\[
U(f) : U(\fg) \to U(\fh)
\]
is a quasi-isomorphism of associative dg algebras. 
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
We consider the spectral sequences induced by the natural filtrations on the enveloping algebras of $\fg$ and $\fh$. 
The map $U(f)$ clearly preserves the natural filtration on the enveloping algebra and so it induces a map of spectral sequences. 
In particular, it induces a map at the $E_1$ page, which is simply the associated graded algebras
\[
{\rm Gr} \; U(f) : \Sym^*(\fg) \to \Sym^*(\fh) .
\] 
The map of spectral sequence converges to the map $U(f) : U(\fg) \to U(\fh)$. 

Now, it is an easy exercise to show that $\fg \to \fh$ is a quasi-isomorphism if and only if it induces a quasi-isomorphism of free commutative dg algebras $\Sym^*(\fg) \to \Sym^*(\fh)$. 
Thus, in one direction, if $\fg \to \fh$ is a quasi-isomorphism, we obtain a quasi-isomorphism at the $E_1$-page, and the result follows. 

In the other direction, if $U(\fg) \to U(\fh)$ is a quasi-isomorphism, then taking associated gradeds we obtain a quasi-isomorphism $\Sym^*(\fg) \to \Sym^*(\fh)$ and hence $\fg \to \fh$ is a quasi-isomorphism by the above remark. 
\end{proof}


\section{Modules and (co)homology}

\subsection{(dg) Modules}

Recall that to every dg vector space $V$ we can associated an associative dg algebra $\End_k(V)$ of endomorphisms. 

\begin{dfn}
Let $\fg$ be a dg Lie algebra.
A {\bf dg $\fg$-module} is a dg vector space $M$ together with a map of dg Lie algebras
\[
\rho : \fg \to \End_k(M) .
\]
A map of dg modules is defined in the obvious way. 
Let $\dgMod_{\fg}$ denote the category of dg $\fg$-modules. 
\end{dfn}

\begin{rmk}
By the universal property of the enveloping algebra, we see that a dg module for $\fg$ is equivalent to a (left) dg module for the associative dg algebra $U(\fg)$. 
\end{rmk}

The category of modules is an abelian category in the obvious way. 
Also, there is the notion of tensor product. 

\begin{dfn}
Suppose $M,N$ are two dg $\fg$-modules.
Define the tensor product dg $\fg$-module $M \tensor N$ to be the tensor product of underlying dg vector spaces with $\fg$-module structure given by
\[
\rho_{M} \tensor 1 + 1 \tensor \rho_N : \fg \to \End_k(M \tensor_k N) = \End_k(M) \tensor_k \End_k(N) .
\]
\end{dfn}

\begin{rmk}
If we think of $M,N$ as dg $U\fg$-modules, then 
\[
M \tensor N = M \tensor_{U\fg} N
\]
as $U \fg$-modules. 
\end{rmk}

\subsection{(Co)Homology}

As for ordinary modules, we have a pair of functors
\[
\begin{array}{cccl}
(-)^\fg : & \dgMod_\fg & \to & \dgVect_k  \\
& M & \mapsto & M^\fg = \{m \in M \; | \; x \cdot m = m \; , \; \forall x \in \fg\} \\
(-)_{\fg} : & \dgMod_{\fg} & \to & \dgVect_k \\
& M & \mapsto & M / \fg \cdot M 
\end{array}
\]
called the invariants/coinvariants respectively. 

\begin{rmk}
Note that 
\[
M^\fg = {\rm Hom}_{U \fg}(k, M)
\]
and 
\[
M_\fg = k \tensor_{U \fg} M .
\] 
\end{rmk}

\begin{lem}
Consider the functor
\[
{\rm triv}_\fg : \dgVect_k \to \dgMod_\fg
\]
that sends a dg vector space to the trivial $\fg$-module.
The functor $M \mapsto M^\fg$ is left adjoint to ${\rm triv}_\fg$. 
The functor $M \mapsto M_\fg$ is right adjoint to ${\rm triv}_\fg$. 
\end{lem}

As a consequence, taking invariants/coinvariants is left/right exact respectively. 
This motivates the following definition. 

\begin{dfn}
Let $\fg$ be a dg Lie algebra.
The {\bf Lie algebra homology} of $\fg$ is the left derived functor of coinvariants
\[
\begin{array}{cccc}
H_*(\fg ; -) : & \dgMod_\fg & \to & \Vect_k \\ 
& M & \mapsto & \LL_*(-)_\fg (M) \\ .
\end{array}
\]
Similarly, the {\bf Lie algebra cohomology} of $\fg$ is the right derived functor of invariants
\[
\begin{array}{cccc}
H^*(\fg ; -) : & \dgMod_\fg & \to & \Vect_k \\ 
& M & \mapsto & \RR_*(-)^\fg (M) \\ .
\end{array}
\]
\end{dfn}

\begin{rmk}
Using the Tor and Ext notation, we can write
\[
H^{\rm Lie}_*(\fg ; M) = {\rm Tor}^{U \fg}_* (k, M)
\]
and 
\[
H_{\rm Lie}^*(\fg ; M) = {\rm Ext}^*_{U \fg}(k, M) .
\] 
\end{rmk}

To compute the Lie algebra homology, for instance, one uses the usual trick for derived functors. 
By first finding a projective resolution, tensoring, then computing the cohomology. 
We proceed by finding a projective resolution of $U\fg$ 

\subsubsection{}

First, we sketch the following general construction for dg Lie algebras.
Given a dg Lie algebra $\fg$ define its {\em cone} to be the dg Lie algebra ${\rm Cone}(\fg)$ to be
\[
{\rm Cone}(\fg)_n = \fg_n \oplus \fg_{n-1}
\]
with differential
\[
\d_n = \left(\begin{array}{cc} \d_{\fg,n} & {\rm id}_{\fg_{n}} \\ 0 & \d_{\fg, n-1} \end{array}\right) : {\rm Cone}(\fg)_{n} = \fg_n \oplus \fg_{n-1} \to \fg_{n+1} \oplus \fg_n = {\rm Cone}(\fg)_{n+1}
\]
and bracket
\[
[(x,y), (x',y')] = \left([x,y]_{\fg}, [x,y'] + [y,x']\right) .
\]

\begin{lem}
There is a natural map of dg Lie algebras
\[
\fg \hookrightarrow {\rm Cone}(\fg) .
\]
Furthermore, ${\rm Cone}(\fg)$ is acyclic.
\end{lem} 

By functoriality of the enveloping functor, the associative algebra $U({\rm Cone}(\fg))$ is acyclic and hence a resolution for the trivial $U \fg$-module.
Thus, we have
\[
H^{\rm Lie}_*(\fg, M) = H^*\left(U({\rm Cone}(\fg)) \tensor_{U \fg} M \right) .
\] 

\begin{dfn}
The Chevalley-Eilenberg complex computing Lie algebra {\em homology} is the dg vector space
\[
\clieu_*(\fg ; M) := U({\rm Cone}(\fg)) \tensor_{U \fg} M .
\] 
Its cohomology is precisely the Lie algebra homology of $M$.
\end{dfn}

\begin{rmk}
Explicitly, as a graded vector space, the CE complex is of the form
\begin{align*}
\clieu_*(\fg ; M) & = U({\rm Cone}(\fg)) \tensor_{U \fg} M  \\ & = \left(\Sym(\fg[1]) \tensor_k U(\fg)\right) \tensor_{U \fg} M \\ &= \Sym(\fg[1]) \tensor_k M .
\end{align*}
Tracing through these isomorphisms, one can deduce that the differential is
\begin{align*}
\d_{CE} (x_1,\ldots, x_n) & = \sum_{i = 1}^n (\pm) x_1 \cdots x_{i-1} (\d x_i) x_{i+1} \cdots x_n \\ & + \sum_{i < j} (\pm) x_1\cdots \Hat{x_i} \cdots x_{j-1} [x_i,x_j] x_{j+1} \cdots x_n .
\end{align*}
\end{rmk}

\subsubsection{}

There is a completely analogous construction for Lie algebra cohomology. 

\begin{dfn}
The Chevalley-Eilenberg complex computing Lie algebra {\em cohomology} is the dg vector space
\[
\clie^*(\fg ; M) := U({\rm Cone}(\fg)) \tensor_{U \fg} M .
\] 
Its cohomology is precisely the Lie algebra homology of $M$
\[
H_{\rm Lie}^*(\fg ; M) = H^*\left(\Hom_{U \fg}(U({\rm Cone}(\fg)), M)\right) .
\]
\end{dfn}

\begin{rmk}
One can identify $\clie^*(\fg ; M)$ with a complex of the form
\[
\clie^*(\fg ; M) = \left(\Sym(\fg^\vee[-1]) \tensor_k M , \d^{CE}\right) .
\]
Note that, when $M = k$ there is an identification 
\[
\clie^*(\fg ; k) = \left(\clieu_*(\fg ; k)\right)^\vee = \Hom_k(\clieu_*(\fg ;k), k) .
\] 
\end{rmk}

\subsubsection{}

The CE complexes for homology and cohomology are functorial in the module input.
They both determine functors
\[
\begin{array}{cccc}
\clieu_*(\fg ; -) : & \dgMod_\fg & \to & \dgVect_k\\
\clie^*(\fg ; -) : & \dgMod_{\fg} & \to & \dgVect_k .
\end{array}
\]

We are interested in a different type of functoriality in the case that $M = k$, the trivial module. 
In this case, we write $\clieu_*(\fg) = \clieu(\fg;k)$ and similarly for cohomology.
A silly statement is that this trivial module is {\em universal} in the sense that it is a module for all dg Lie algebras.
Thus, we can contemplate the functoriality of homology/cohomology in the Lie algebra factor. 

\begin{lem}
The CE complex for homology/cohomology determine functors
\[
\begin{array}{cccc}
\clieu_*(-) : & \dgLie_k & \to & \dgVect_k\\
\clie^*(-) : & \dgLie_k & \to & \left(\dgVect_k\right)^{op} .
\end{array}
\]
Moreover, if $f : \fg \to \fh$ is a quasi-isomorphism of dg Lie algebras, then the induced maps
\[
\begin{array}{cccc}
\clieu_*(f) : & \clieu_*(\fg) & \to & \clieu_*(\fh)\\
\clie^*(\fg) : & \clie^*(\fh) & \to & \clie^*(\fg) 
\end{array}
\]
are quasi-isomorphisms. 
\end{lem}

\end{document}
