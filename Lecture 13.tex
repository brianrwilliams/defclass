\title{Lecture 10: Small algebras}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

In this lecture we have two goals: 
\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)] recall the standard model structure on the category of dg vector spaces, and transfer it to model category structures on dg Lie algebras and commutative dg algebras;
\item[(2)] formulate a variant of the nerve construction that produces an $\infty$-category from an ordinary model category. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Transferring model structures}

\section{From model to $\infty$-categories}

We have already discussed how one can obtain an $\infty$-category both from an ordinary category (the {\em classical} nerve) and a simplicial category (the {\em simplicial} / {\em coherent} nerve). 
In the latter case, the simplicial nerve remembers the actual simpicial model category structure and set up the equivalence between two different theories of $\infty$-categories. 

Now, we would like to discuss a construction of an $\infty$-category from a model category that is sensitive to all of the structures of the model category. 
For instance, the $\infty$-category will detect weak equivalences
