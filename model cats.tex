\section{Some categorical remarks}

\subsection{(Co)Limits}

We recall some general notions in ordinary category theory. 
For a textbook reference see \cite{MacLane}.

Let $\sC$ and $\sI$ be categories. 
For each object $X \in \sC$ let $\ul{X} : \sI \to \sC$ be the functor that sends every object of $\sI$ to $X \in \sC$ and every morphism to the identity. 
This construction extends to a functor
\[
\ul{(-)} : \sC \to \Fun(\sI, \sC) .
\]

\begin{dfn}
Suppose $\sI$ is a small category and let $F : \sI \to \sC$ be a functor. 
A {\bf colimit} of $F$ is an object $X \in \sC$ together with a natural transformation
\[
t : F \to \ul{X}
\]
such that for every $Y \in \sC$ and every natural transformation $s : F \to \ul{Y}$ there exists a unique map $s' : X \to Y$ making $\ul{s'} t = s$. 
\end{dfn}

Any two colimits are naturally isomorphic. 
If the colimit of a functor $F : \sI \to \sC$ exists, we will write it as $\colim_{\sI} F \in \sC$. 

Many familiar categories posses the property that {\em all} colimits exist. 
These include $\Set, \Top$, and $\Vect_k$.
Moreover, colimits are functorial in the natural way. 

\begin{dfn}
A category $\sI$ is called {\bf filtered} if, for any finite category $\sJ$ and functor $J : \sJ \to \sI$, there exists an object $i \in \sI$ and a natural transformation $F \to \ul{i}$. 
\end{dfn}

If $F : \sI \to \sC$ is a functor, $\sI$ is filtered, and $\colim_{\sI} F$ exists, then the colimit is called a {\em filtered colimit}. 
A natural example of a filtered category is the poset
\[
\sI = \ZZ_+ = \{0 \to 1 \to 2 \to \cdots \} .
\]
Resulting colimits are special types of filtered colimits called {\em sequential colimits}. 

\subsubsection{}
The notion of a limit is defined in a dual way. 
The aforementioned categories also admit all limits. 

\section{The idea of a model category}
Roughly, the theory of model categories was developed to better handle the notion of a ``homotopy equivalence". 
For us, the fundamental example of a homotopy equivalence is a quasi-isomorphism of dg vector spaces. 

The first, and perhaps most obvious, attempt to encode homotopy, or {\em weak}, equivalences in a category is to prescribe some class of morphisms that ware well-behaved with respect to composition. 
The definition is the following. 

\begin{dfn}
A {\bf category with weak equivalences} is a category $\sC$ together with a set
\[
\sW \subset {\rm Mor}(\sC)
\]
such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $f$ is an isomorphism, then $f \in \sW$;
\item if $f,g$ are morphisms such that $f \circ g$ exists then: if two of $f, g, f \circ g$ are in $\sW$ then the third is as well (`two out of three").
\end{enumerate}
\end{dfn}

\subsection{Model categories}

\begin{dfn}
Let $\sC$ be a category and $K \subset {\rm Mor}(\sC)$ be a subset of morphisms. 
A morphism $f : X \to Y$ in $\sC$ has the {\bf left lifting property} (LLP) with respect to $K$ if for any morphism $g : W \to Z$ in $K$ and solid line diagram
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
X \ar[r] \ar[d,"f"] & W \ar[d,"g"] \\ 
Y \ar[r] \ar[ur, dotted, "\exists h"'] & Z 
\end{tikzcd}
\]
there exists a dotted map $h : Y \to W$ making the total diagram commute. 
Dually, we say $f : X \to Y$ has the {\bf right lifting property} (RLP) with respect to $K$ if
for any morphism $g : W \to Z$ in $K$ and solid line diagram
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
W \ar[r] \ar[d,"g"] & X \ar[d,"f"] \\ 
Z \ar[r] \ar[ur, dotted, "\exists h"'] & Y
\end{tikzcd}
\]
there exists a dotted map $h : Z \to X$ making the total diagram commute. 
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}
A model category is a category with weak equivalences $(\sC, \sW)$ together with distinguished classes ${\rm Cof}, {\rm Fib} \subset {\rm Mor}(\sC)$ satisfying the following axioms:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
